        <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
        <blockquote>
          Although procedural generation is popular among game developers, academic research on the topic has primarily focused on new
          applications, with some research into empirical analysis. In this
          paper we relate theoretical work in information theory to the generation of content for games. We prove that there is a relationship
          between the Kolomogorov complexity of the most complex artifact
          a generator can produce, and the size of that generator‚Äôs possibility
          space. In doing so, we identify the limiting relationship between
          the knowledge encoded in a generator, the density of its output
          space, and the intricacy of the artifacts it produces. We relate our
          result to the experience of expert procedural generator designers,
          and illustrate it with some examples.

        <h4>THEOREM</h4>
        For an ideal generator <code>G</code> where:
        <ul>
          <li><code>|G|</code> is the length of the generator's source code</li>
          <li><code>P(G)</code> is the log of the generator's possibility space</li>
          <li><code>K*(G)</code> is the highest Kolmogorov complexity among all the artefacts</li>
        </ul>
        we have the following inequalities:
